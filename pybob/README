This folder contains a bunch of python used throughout Chez Bob.

For the most part, it runs under python3. You should use a virtualenv. We'd be
using pipenv, but getting that to work cleanly with apache wsgi is trickier.

The virtualenv should be stored within this directory at env/. The
requirements.txt file has the packages you need.

This directory is diverse. While it is configured to be mostly include-able
from python, it contains a bunch of distinct elements. Hopefully many of them
have READMEs of their own.


If you try to install the dependencies and it fails because Cython is missing,
install Cython first. This is a dependency ordering issue with pip.
