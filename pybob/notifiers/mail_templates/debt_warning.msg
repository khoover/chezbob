Hi {nickname},

Please know that you are at the cusp of being singled out on the large display in Chez Bob, the third floor display, and via a public Slack post as a debtor to Chez Bob.

Please pay off your debt before making further purchases to avoid this from happening.

Thanks very much,
- Chez Bob

PS. We accept credit cards online at https://chezbob.ucsd.edu/payment#{username} !
