The easiest way to redirect stdout/stderr to a file under systemd (at least with
relatively old but widely deployed systemd) is to redirect them to syslog, and
then tell rsyslog to log them to a file.

This file contains the configuration files for rsyslog to do just that. They
should be symlinked into /etc/rsyslog.d
