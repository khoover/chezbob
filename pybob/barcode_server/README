This directory contains two barcode servers (daemons):
 - a nearly-drop-in replacement of barcode[i]d from bob2k14 (barcode_server.py)
 - a similar server using crossbar, used by espresso (barcode_server_wamp.py)

The barcode scanners support:
 - Serial barcode scanners (like the one bolted to the soda machine)
 - HID (keyboard-emulating) barcode scanners (like main term's and espresso's)
 - NFC readers

NFC reader support is hacky. It only runs under python2.7 because the NFC
library didn't support python3 as of writing. We present the NFC tag's serial
number of (prepended with "NFC:") as a barcode. Everwhere else sees NFC tags as
barcodes.

This directory is basically the only thing left on python2.7. Thus it needs its
OWN virtualenv that is shared between both barcode servers.

You need to create it like this:
    $ virtualenv -p python2.7 env2.7
    $ . env2.7/bin/activate
    $ pip2 install -r requirements.txt
    $ deactivate

If you don't want/need NFC support, than the whole thing will happily run under
python3 if you have the applicable packages installed.

The configuration of the barcode server is slightly different than that of
bob2k14's barcode server, but once you handle configuration, it will happily
speak to sodad.
