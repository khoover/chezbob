# The core of the double-entry bookkeeping system is in the three tables
# Account, Transaction, and Split.  A transaction consists of a set of splits,
# each of which represents money flowing into or out of a single account.  A
# transaction must be balanced--the sum of the values of all the splits in a
# transaction must be zero.  This constraint is not currently enforced by the
# database, and so must be maintained by any code editing the database.
